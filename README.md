# Programming Languages and Their Suitability for Tasks

## Introduction
### Why are certain programming languages more suited for certain tasks than others?

Programming languages are created with various features that are supposed to give them an edge over others when completing certain tasks. Some important features that one might strive for include performance, ease of use, platform dependencies, memory, etc.

With the understanding that different programming languages are used to accomplish different tasks as they have a certain “edge”, it’s important to ask: *How did they achieve this?* These languages are suited for their respective roles based on how their core design aligns with the tasks that need to be completed. An example of this can be with memory management. If someone were to create a language and wanted to change the performance of certain components, they’d have to have control over the amount of memory being used. This is especially important in areas such as game development, where avoiding performance bottlenecks, like garbage collection pauses, is critical.

## Historical Development
### When was the first programming language created?

The first programming language first arose in the 1940s, known as Assembly Language. Assembly language was developed with the primary goal of making it easier to control early electronic computers, such as ENIAC. Instead of typing in 0’s and 1’s to edit configurations in the hardware, developers could use assembly language for more human-like instructions. Following this, Fortran was developed and is considered the first high-level programming language, specifically designed for scientific and engineering computations. These early languages highlight the importance of the evolution of programming languages in advancing technology in specific areas.
